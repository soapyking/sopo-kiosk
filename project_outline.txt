Objective
---------

Maintain data about visitors, event participants, and volunteers that helps shop managers and administrators generate meaningful statistics and keep in touch with the Sopo fam.

Use
---

We expect guests to opt-in to giving information about themselves to the Kiosk. That information can include but may not be limited to phone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses, names... etc. They may also have the choice to be truly anonymous, and the Kiosk will give the guest the option to sign in as an anonymous user. Users are identified by their **name? phone number? email? (this is unclear)**

Administrators and managers must have the ability to use the application to generate statistics and dump raw data over user-supplied timelines. These statistics and the raw data must be easily (point and click) generated and available for transfer to external storage.

Volunteers will sign like a guest but have the time they spent volunteering tracked by the Kiosk.
